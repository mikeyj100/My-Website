    <h1>Carp Task</h1>
    <h2>This task requires research of the following design terms: contrast, repetition, proximity and alignment. In addition to this, application of the design terms had to be presented through a film festival poster</h2>
    <h3>Using design terms such as contrast, alignment, proximity and repetition in a media form such as posters can be essential to attract the human eye. Contrast can determine the importance of whatever information is displayed. Regarding a film festival, information that will need to stand out would be the festival name, date and location. Alignment is essential too because when writing is central it is more natural on the eye. It can be argued proximity and repetition are the least important of the four as it is present in less media forms and is hard too perfect and seen as a more artistic and unique style of design which varies in effectiveness.</h3>
