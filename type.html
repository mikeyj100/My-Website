    <h1>Typography Task</h1>
    <h2>The typographic system task required research surrounding 8 different typographic systems. As well as this each typographic system had to be portrayed correlating to it's chosen system</h2>
    <h3>Typographic systems are designed to guide the viewer and help the designer make decisions about where to place different elements. A reoccurring theme used throughout my typographic posters was simplicity with a black white and red design. These colours fit well with the aesthetic design of the website, specifically the white part gives the user an open feel when viewing each systems due to there being no border. I highlighted the main selling points such as ‘Frank Bowling’ to catch the users eye. </h3>
