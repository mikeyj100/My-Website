    <h1>Coding Task</h1>
    <h2>The coding task requires a working GitHub link so the user can access all my previous html/css worksheets and view them. You can access this below, above my 500 word reflection</h2>

    <h3>DESIGN FUNDAMENTALS REFLECTION: The design fundamentals website assignment has been a challenging but enjoyable experiment. From having zero experience regarding programming a website, to creating a functional website with all required tasks included. The tasks required a level of creativity and a clear understanding of design terms to create an end product. Underlining all this we had to implement areas of personalisation to the website. This included an about me section which was on the home page. In addition to this, further personalisation included my favourite colour, red, being a consistent theme throughout the website to complete an aesthetically simplistic look.

        One of the tasks that I was required to complete was researching 8 different typographic systems. Once I was familiar with the definition of each one I had to create a poster using Adobe Illustrator applying what I had learnt to each design with a short description underneath. Being completely new to Adobe Illustrator I had to watch tutorials to learn my way around the application and to find out how every tool worked. This was fairly straight forward however, I did struggle on the creative side of the task but made sure every poster had an accurate representation of each typographic system. 
        
        Similarly to the Typography task, my level of creativity limited my success. Here I had to learn the design terms: contrast, proximity, repetition and alignment and apply them to different versions of a poster advertising a non-profit film festival using Adobe Indesign. It is clear to see why designers implement these different design terms in their work. As each design term can be effective in its own way regarding to what the design is intended to achieve. For example an advertisement flyer is more likely to include contrast as a design term to catch the human eye. Whereas alignment and proximity is more likely used for a design that is not intended to catch as many people’s attention but is instead intended to be appreciated by other design enthusiasts.
        
        The UX (User Experience) task required me to visually explain the strategy and scope of my website. To do this I needed to create a short essay talking about the content I had planned to include. As well as this I needed to include a flowchart to display how the pages would flow and a wire frame showing how the actual structure of the website. Finally to complete the UX task, images of early development of the website had to be displayed with an explanation relating the choices I made. The UX task provided structure for my ideas helping me bring them to life whilst following a detailed plan.
        
        The final task within my design fundamentals website was the coding task. I was required to provide a working link to my own GitHub account making my coding worksheet examples available and accessible publicly to any user. Prior to the course I had zero knowledge regarding programming or code let alone html and css, so I assumed this would be a difficult task to fulfil. However, the worksheets provided clear instructions written in a humorous manner making them satisfying to complete.
        
        In conclusion, this assignment tested my ability to research and learn the ins and outs of different softwares combining together to make one final project. My previous experience with photoshop helped me with Indesign and Illustrator as the general interface is incredibly similar. Learning to code was very enriching as things wouldn’t always go the way you wanted so it was important to persist and experiment to the best of my ability.
